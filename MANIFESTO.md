# The Trixle Theory of Everything: A Manifesto

This repository represents a departure from "Probability-Wave" physics in favor of **Structural Geometric Determinism**. It posits that the universe is not made of particles *in* space, but is a singular, contiguous 3D lattice.

## 1. The Substance (The Vacuum)
The vacuum is a **Quasicrystal Foam** composed of interlocking Boerdijk-Coxeter (BC) helices.
* **The Fundamental Unit:** A "Trixle" (one step in the BC-helix).
* **The Ground State ($N=122$):** The Higgs Field is the intrinsic curvature of the vacuum.
* **The Medium:** Space is a "Loaded Spring" under constant torsional tension.

## 2. The Actors (Matter)
Matter is a **Topological Soliton**—a knot tied in the lattice.
* **Identity:** A particle's mass is its **Arc Length** (number of trixles).
    * **Electron ($N=136$):** A simple high-torsion loop.
    * **Proton ($N=1836$):** A complex, stable Figure-8 knot.
* **Charge:** Charge is **Torsion**. Left-hand twist = Negative; Right-hand twist = Positive.

## 3. The Mechanics (Forces)
* **Electromagnetism:** Direct propagation of twist across the lattice.
* **Gravity:** The **Entropy of the Lattice**. Gravity is the statistical probability ($1$ in $10^{39}$) that the random fluctuations of the $N=122$ vacuum will align to create a pressure gradient.
* **Strong Force:** **Geometric Minimization**. Two knots fuse because the universe prefers the lower-surface-area state of a single larger knot.

## 4. The Dynamics (Time & Expansion)
* **Time:** The irreversible process of **Lattice Collapse**. The universe is "unwinding" its Big Bang tension. We cannot travel backward because the "past" is physically relaxed geometry that no longer exists.
* **Expansion:** The "Exhalation" of the universe. As the coiled-spring vacuum relaxes, it takes up more volume.
* **Redshift:** **Lattice Friction**. Photons lose energy navigating the "grain" of the vacuum over billions of years (Tired Light).

## 5. Summary of Derivations
| Constant | Geometric Source | Prediction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha ($\alpha$)** | Loop Geometry | $1/137.035$ |
| **Proton Mass** | Knot Complexity | $1836.15$ m_e |
| **Gravity ($G$)** | $N_{proton} \cdot 2^{N_{Higgs}}$ | $10^{39}$ (Hierarchy Problem) |
