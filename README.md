# The Trixle Theory: Geometric Origin of Mass
**A Computational Study of Boerdijk-Coxeter Lattice Resonances**

## Overview
This repository models the quantum vacuum as a discrete, helical packing of regular tetrahedra. It investigates whether fundamental particle masses arise as natural geometric resonances within this lattice.

## Key Findings
* **Higgs Candidate (N=122):** Identified a ground-state stability island at N=122, aligning with the Higgs mass (~125 GeV).
* **Dark Matter Ratio:** The Proton (N=1836) appears as the 15th harmonic of this ground state, explaining the 5:1 cosmological abundance ratio.
* **Diquark Structure:** Topological analysis of the proton loop reveals a spontaneous Figure-8/Dipole geometry.
* **Chiral Asymmetry:** Simulating "Antimatter" (Left-Handed curvature) requires 1.9x more geometric energy than Matter.
