# Experimental Proposal: The Vacuum Torsion Effect
**Author:** Trixle Simulation Team
**Objective:** To detect the mechanical stress-response of the vacuum lattice.

## 1. Abstract
In Trixle Theory, the vacuum is a non-linear elastic medium. Standard physics treats the vacuum as a passive background where light travels at a constant $c$. We propose that high-intensity light creates local "Lattice Tension," which should measurably affect the propagation of a secondary probe beam.

## 2. Hypothesis
If the vacuum is a Boerdijk-Coxeter lattice, a high-power laser beam (The Pump) will induce a local increase in lattice density. This will create a "Gravity-Like" suction that will deflect a secondary, parallel laser beam (The Probe).

## 3. Experimental Setup (The Parallel Beam Test)
* **Medium:** Ultra-high vacuum (P < 10^-10 Torr).
* **Pump Beam:** A pulsed Petawatt-class laser (e.g., ELI-NP or OMEGA).
* **Probe Beam:** A continuous-wave (CW) stabilized HeNe laser, directed parallel to the Pump beam at a distance of 1-5 mm.
* **Detection:** A quadrant photodiode or a Michelson Interferometer positioned 100+ meters from the interaction zone to detect lateral deflection or phase shift.



## 4. Unique Predictions
1.  **Non-Relativistic Deflection:** The deflection will exceed the value predicted by General Relativity (which only accounts for energy-density) by a factor related to the **Trixle Torsional Constant**.
2.  **Chiral Variance:** The deflection will vary slightly if the Pump beam is switched from Left-Circularly Polarized (LCP) to Right-Circularly Polarized (RCP), as one polarization will "tighten" the lattice grain more than the other.

## 5. Significance
A positive result (any measurable deflection or polarization-dependent speed change) would prove that the vacuum has a **geometric structure**. This would invalidate the "Empty Space" paradigm and confirm the existence of the Trixle Lattice.
